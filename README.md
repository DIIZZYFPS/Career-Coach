An AI-powered career coaching application that analyzes resumes against job descriptions, identifies skill gaps, and provides personalized career guidance. Built with a fine-tuned language model and modern desktop technologies.

## Important Note

As of right now due to the lack of macOS support with Unsloth the Mac version currently does not work, I am aware of this and am working on a workaround.

## ü§ñ Technical Details

### Architecture Overview

The Career Coach application consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend**: Electron-based desktop application built with React and TypeScript
2. **Backend**: FastAPI server with AI model integration
3. **AI Model**: Fine-tuned language model optimized for career coaching

### AI Model Details

#### Base Model
- **Architecture**: Gemma-3-4b-it (Google's Gemma 3 Instruct model)
- **Size**: 4 billion parameters
- **Quantization**: 4-bit quantized for efficient inference
- **Context Length**: 2048 tokens

#### Fine-tuning Process

The model was fine-tuned using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** technique for efficient training:

**Training Configuration:**
```python
# LoRA Parameters
r = 16                    # LoRA rank
lora_alpha = 16          # LoRA scaling parameter
lora_dropout = 0         # No dropout for stability
target_modules = ["all-linear"]  # Apply to all linear layers

# Training Parameters
batch_size = 2           # Per device batch size
gradient_accumulation = 4 # Effective batch size: 8
learning_rate = 2e-4     # Conservative learning rate
max_steps = 1000         # Training steps
warmup_steps = 5         # Learning rate warmup
optimizer = "adamw_8bit" # Memory-efficient optimizer
```

**Dataset Preparation:**
- **Format**: JSONL with instruction-following format
- **Size**: ~2000 career coaching examples
- **Structure**: Each example contains:
  - `instruction`: Task description
  - `input`: Resume and job description
  - `output`: Analysis with skill gaps, learning suggestions, and interview questions

**Training Data Format:**
```json
{
  "instruction": "Analyze the provided resume against the job description.",
  "input": "Resume: '...' Job Description: '...'",
  "output": {
    "analysis": "...",
    "skill_gaps": ["...", "..."],
    "learning_suggestions": [{"skill": "...", "resource": "..."}],
    "interview_questions": ["...", "..."]
  }
}
```

**Optimization Techniques:**
- **4-bit Quantization**: Reduces memory usage by 75%
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trades compute for memory
- **Mixed Precision**: FP16/BF16 for faster training
- **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**: Only trains ~1% of parameters

#### Model Performance

- **Training Time**: ~2 hours on RTX 4090
- **Memory Usage**: ~8GB VRAM during inference
- **Response Quality**: Specialized for career coaching tasks
- **Inference Speed**: ~50 tokens/second on modern GPUs

#### Deployment Strategy

1. **Model Storage**: Hosted on Hugging Face Hub (`DIIZZY/career-coach-v2`)
2. **Local Caching**: Downloaded to user's machine on first run
3. **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation if model unavailable
4. **Progressive Loading**: Stream responses for better UX
